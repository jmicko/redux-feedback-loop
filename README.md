# Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

Make an app that accepts feedback, similar to the one used by Prime Digital Academy. Each feedback item should be in a seperate database, and when all feedback is collected, should be sent to the server and stored in a database.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

### Setup

- Create a `prime_feedback` database in Postgress.
- Set up database tables with the code from (`database.sql`).

- Start server

    - ```
        npm install
        npm run server
        ```

- Once the server is running, open a new terminal and start the client app.

- Start client

    - ```
        npm run client
        ```



## Built With

- NodeJS
- React
- Postgres
- Express
- Redux
